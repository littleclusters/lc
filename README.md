# `lc` CLI

_Learn distributed systems by building them from scratch._

Progressive challenges to learn distributed systems and other complex systems by implementing them yourself.

## Quick Start

Install:

```console
$ go install github.com/littleclusters/lc/cmd/lc@latest
```

Or with Homebrew:

```console
$ brew tap littleclusters/tap
$ brew install littleclusters/tap/lc
```

See [littleclusters.com](https://littleclusters.com/guides/cli/#installation) for version pinning and other installation methods.

Start a challenge:

```console
$ lc list             # List available challenges
$ lc init kv-store    # Create challenge in current directory
$ lc test             # Test your implementation
$ lc next             # Advance to the next stage
```

## How it Works

Write code, run tests, get detailed feedback. Progress through stages as you build real systems.
